# Spring Project

# Project Structure: 
d a Java project with at least one package (com.example.demo.student). Within this package, you have a class named Student.

# Persistence Layer:
using JPA (Java Persistence API) for object-relational mapping. This allows you to map Java classes to database tables and perform CRUD operations on those entities.

# Database Management System:
using PostgreSQL as the database management system to store student information.

# Student Entity Class:

Attributes:
id: Unique identifier for each student.
name: Name of the student.
email: Email address of the student.
dob: Date of birth of the student.
Transient Attribute: age - This attribute is transient, meaning it won't be persisted to the database. It's calculated based on the dob attribute and the current date to determine the age of the student.
# Constructors:
Parameterized constructors to initialize the Student object with or without an id.
# Getter and Setter Methods:
Accessor and mutator methods for all attributes, including id, name, email, dob, and age.
# Sequence Generator: 
defined a sequence generator named student_sequence to generate unique identifiers for the id attribute of Student objects.

Age Calculation: calculating the age of the student dynamically using the Period.between() method in the getAge() method.
